# Hey 👋🏻, I'm [Lineu](https://lineupastorelli.com)

Hello, I'm Lineu 🦄, I'm from Brazil! I'm a full stack developer 🚀, using Stack JavaScript / Typescript with React, React Native and Node. Currently my biggest focus is on Front-end development and also mobile, I ventured a little also in Swift. I participate in some open source projects, one of  [👨🏻‍💻 @Lucas Montano](https://github.com/lucasmontano) [🌦 openweathermap-reactnative](https://github.com/lucasmontano/openweathermap-reactnative), a [🏆 personal portfolio](https://github.com/lineuxyz/my-portfolio-project), where I developed everything using React, and also, a project on a timeline about [political events in Brazil](https://github.com/BrasilNaLinha/frontend), together with a development team [🇧🇷 @BrasilNaLinha](https://github.com/BrasilNaLinha). I love technology 💻, code and this whole ecosystem.
